# MobileAgentsThreads
3-Tier Implementation of an ALP of the Mobile Agents using Multi-Threaded Socket Java programming. 

>> Content
  The solution of Question (ii) in Assignment (1)
  It contains 3 source files (A source file for each Node)
    (1) SensingNode.java
    (2) ComputationalNode.java
    (3) DecisionMakingNode.java
 
 >> Build & Run:
  (1) Open the Project using Netbeans IDE.
  (2) Build Each of the 3 Source file separately.
  (3) Run the DecisionMakingNode.java File.
  (4) Run the ComputationalNode.java File.
  (5) Run the SensingNode.java File.
  (6) Enter the Speed of the car in the SensingNode Terminal. [To act as the reading of the senor]
  (7) Enter the Number of the Street in the SensingNode Terminal. [To act as the reading of the senor]
  (8) The Final Result will be in the ComputationalNode.
  (9) You can run the SensingNode Multiple Time in the same run of the ComputationalNode & the DecisionMakingNode.
